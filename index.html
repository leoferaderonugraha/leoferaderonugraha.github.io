        <h3>Welcome, My name is Leo and this is my biography</h3>
        Hello , My name is Leo and i was born on Bandung 14 May 2001, first time i know programming is on grade 8 and really code on grade 9.
        <br /><a href="Https://python.org">Python</a>, that's my first programming language to code, i really love <a href="Https://python.org">Python</a> because <a href="Https://python.org">Python</a> is easy to learn and easy to understand,
        i've used <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> to code and running under <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/">Windows</a>.
        <br />And then i tried some programming language like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>,<a href="https://java.com/">Java</a>, and some several programming language.
        <br />The most important things in programming is what programming language do you used to make what you want.
        <br />Like for desktop app you can use <a href="Https://python.org">Python</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>, <a href="https://java.com/">Java</a>, etc.
        And for web you can use <a href="https://php.net">PHP</a>, <a href="https://javascript.com">JavaScript</a>, etc.
        <br />Now i was 15 years old , i'm studying at Yayasan Atikan Sunda Highschool and i had entered grade 10, i live at Gateway Apartment, Cicadas with my parents.

      <h3>The reason why i love programming</h3>
      Because i love to write my imagination, and programming is also fun.<br />
      And programming also teach your logic with problem solving like finding bugs (program errors), wrong logic (because computer didn't understand what you think and computer just understand what you write), and programming is also makes you more creative.</p>
